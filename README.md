# Refabricated-Info
An information repository for Farmer's Delight Refabricated.

This is made with 1.20.1 in mind.

## Why was this moved here?
For two reasons:

1. Pull Requests can be done for if a developer does not have their mod included here.
2. To discourage comments being left on the information document that's meant to attack either of the ports' existence.
